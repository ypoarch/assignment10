## Assignment Instructions:
1. Open the "editme.html" file. You'll see that this file has already been configured to use all Bootstrap CSS and JS. All Bootstrap documentation can be found at http://getbootstrap.com/.
2. Using the Bootstrap grid system, create a full-width header, a four-column left sidebar, an eight-column right content area, and a full-width footer. Grid documentation can be found at http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid.
3. Add any two Bootstrap components to your page. Feel free to add whatever you'd like, so long as it's made with Bootstrap. Component documentation can be found at http://getbootstrap.com/components/. If necessary, add JavaScript, which is documented at http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/.
4. Make sure your HTML validates.
5. Submit the completed project via GitHub pull request before the beginning of class on 11/19/14.

## Grading Criteria:
1. A header, sidebar, content area and footer, built using Bootstrap's grid: 4pts.
2. Two functioning components, built using one of Boostrap's components: 4pts.
3. Validated markup turned in on time via a GitHub pull request: 2pt.
